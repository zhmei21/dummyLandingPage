                        <h3>Benefits</h3>
                        <p>
                            Regular consumption of coffee can provide increased 
                            energy and alertness, enhanced cognitive function, 
                            thanks to its
                            antioxidant properties, as well as potential liver protection.
                            <br />However, it's important to note that consuming coffee 
                            excessively or in large quantities may lead to negative effects
                            such as insomnia, increased heart rate, or digestive issues. 
                            It's essential to practice moderation and be mindful of
                            personal sensitivity to caffeine when enjoying coffee

                        <h3>What tools you need</h3>
                        <p>
                            When it comes to making coffee, 
                            there are some essential tools like a coffee grinder,
                            brewing device, and kettle.
                            However, you can also get creative 
                            and use what you already have at home.
                            While a coffee scale, tamper, 
                            and milk frother can enhance 
                            your coffee-making experience, they
                            are not essential and can be 
                            substituted with manual techniques or 
                            skipped altogether. 
                            The key is to adapt and use the
                            tools and resources available to you in 
                            order to enjoy a satisfying cup of coffee.

                    <h3>My First Coffee</h3>
                    <h4>18.02.2023</h4>
                    <p>
                        Drinking my first coffee was a 
                        transformative experience, a rite of passage into 
                        the world of adulthood and caffeinated
                        delights. It happened on a crisp morning, 
                        the air tinged with anticipation. 
                        <br />
                        As I cradled the warm cup in my hands, the
                        rich aroma wafted up, 
                        enveloping me in a comforting embrace.
                        With hesitant lips, I took my first sip, 
                        and a symphony of flavors danced upon my tongue. 
                        The initial bitterness
                        surprised me, momentarily causing a puckering 
                        sensation, but it swiftly transformed into a 
                        delightful warmth that spread
                        throughout my body.
                        <br />
                        My first coffee experience opened a door 
                        to a realm of possibilities. 
                        It became a catalyst for exploration, as I
                        ventured into different brewing methods, 
                        diverse origins of beans, and unique blends.
                        My first coffee will forever remain a cherished 
                        memory, an initiation into a world where each cup 
                        holds the promise of
                        discovery, connection, and the simple pleasure of 
                        savoring life's little moments.

                        earthy petrichor. The sound of the brewing process, 
                        the bubbling of the coffee, echoes in harmony with 
                        the pitter-patter
                        of raindrops outside, creating a melodic 
                        backdrop for contemplation and introspection.
                        <br />
                        With a steaming mug in hand, each sip 
                        becomes a moment of respite, a retreat from the 
                        outside world. The velvety texture
                        of the coffee blankets the palate,

                        damp weather.

                        Coffee becomes a companion, 
                        a silent confidant during these 
                        introspective moments. It sparks creativity, 
                        inviting us to
                        lose ourselves in a world of thoughts, 
                        dreams, and the gentle tapping of raindrops 
                        against the window.
                        <br />
                        It reminds us to embrace the beauty of rainy days, 
                        to appreciate the small moments of tranquility they 
                        offer, and to
                        cherish the simple pleasures 
                        found in a cup of coffee.
